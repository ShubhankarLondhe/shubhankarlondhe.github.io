Hello there!

I am Shubhankar Londhe, a computational biology PhD student with [Prof. Julien Gagneur](https://www.professoren.tum.de/en/gagneur-julien) at the Technical University of Munich (TUM) and Helmholtz Munich. Iâ€™m curious about how rare genetic variants influence complex traits and diseases, and I explore these questions using large biomedical datasets like the UK Biobank and Solve-RD.

Previously, I completed my Bachelor's and Master's in Science at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Pune, in India.
